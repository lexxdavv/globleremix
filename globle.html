<h1>Global Game Remix</h1>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Globle is a fun and interactive way to explore the world map. Every day, you’re given a new "Mystery Country" to figure out. As you guess different countries, the game gives you hints by showing how close your guesses are—hotter colors mean you’re getting closer to the right answer.</p>


<!--<p>This project is a remake of the game Globle by Trainwreck Labs. I am working on a project inspired by the game Globle <a href="https://globle-game.com”>Globle</a>. In Globle, there is a new Mystery Country to guess every day. You try to figure out which country it is by guessing, and the game shows you how close you are with colors on a globe. The hotter the color, the closer you are to the right answer.</p> -->
